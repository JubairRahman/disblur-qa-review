# üìä Key Differences Between Functional and UI/UX Test Cases

When testing a product, different types of test cases focus on various aspects. Below is an overview of the key differences between **Functional Test Cases** and **UI/UX Test Cases**.

---

## üîß **Functional Test Cases** (e.g., `functional-test-cases.md`)

- **Focus:** 
  - Tests the **core functionality** of the extension to ensure all features perform as expected.
  
- **Purpose:**
  - Validates if the **core features** (such as enabling blur, toggling settings, saving preferences, etc.) are operational.
  
- **Key Areas Tested:**
  - **Activation and Deactivation** of the extension or features.
  - **Settings application** (e.g., toggling options like "Blur Server Icons").
  - **Persistence** of settings and configurations after browser restarts.
  
- **Examples of Test Scenarios:**
  - Installing and activating the extension.
  - Modifying settings and checking if changes are retained.
  - Verifying that the extension interacts correctly with Discord and other platforms.

- **Challenges:**
  - Handling edge cases, especially with browser and platform interactions.

## üé® **UI/UX Test Cases** (e.g., `ui-ux-test-cases.md`)

- **Focus:** 
  - Tests the **user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)** of the extension.
  
- **Purpose:**
  - Ensures the **design** is consistent, intuitive, and that users can interact with the extension effectively.
  
- **Key Areas Tested:**
  - **Visual Design:** Ensures that buttons, icons, and layout are clear, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing.
  - **Interaction Flow:** Verifies if buttons, checkboxes, and other UI elements are responsive and functional.
  - **Accessibility and Feedback:** Checks if users get proper feedback (e.g., confirmation messages) and if the extension is usable for people with accessibility needs.
  
- **Examples of Test Scenarios:**
  - Verifying that the extension icon is clear and recognizable.
  - Ensuring all buttons are functional and provide appropriate feedback.
  - Testing keyboard navigation for accessibility.

- **Challenges:**
  - Addressing diverse user needs and ensuring the design works across multiple platforms and devices.

## üß© **Complementary Nature of Both Test Types**

Both **Functional** and **UI/UX** test cases are **complementary** and focus on different but equally important aspects of the user experience:

- **Functional Test Cases** ensure that the extension's features are operational and work without issues.
- **UI/UX Test Cases** ensure that users have an intuitive, pleasant, and accessible experience while interacting with the extension.

By combining these two types of test cases, we can ensure the extension not only functions correctly but also delivers a high-quality user experience.

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Conclusion**

Both test types are essential for ensuring the extension provides a seamless experience for users. While functional tests guarantee the core functionality, UI/UX tests ensure the product‚Äôs design and usability are top-notch.

## üîß **Additional Considerations**

- **Test Prioritization:** 
  - Functional tests may be prioritized early on, while UI/UX tests may be more relevant in later stages of development.
  
- **Real-World Example:** 
  - A functional test checks that the "Save" button saves the settings, but a UI/UX test ensures the button is clearly visible and gives proper feedback after saving.
  
- **Tools and Methods:** 
  - Functional Testing: Selenium, Postman, etc.
  - UI/UX Testing: User testing platforms, visual regression tools, etc.
  
- **Metrics for Success:** 
  - Functional tests are success-driven based on feature performance.
  - UI/UX tests are more qualitative, requiring user feedback or visual checks for clarity.
